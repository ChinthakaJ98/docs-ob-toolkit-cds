#Identifier-first Authentication

Identifier-first authentication allows identifying the individuals prior to authenticating them. It retrieves 
the identity of the user without using authentication information and uses that identity to control the authentication 
flow.

You can implement identifier-first authentication using a custom local authenticator. For more information, see 
[Identifier-first Flow Handler](https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/learn/identifier-first-flow-handler/#configuring-identifier-first-handler-in-the-login-flow). 
WSO2 Open Banking consists of an identifier-first authenticator by default.
