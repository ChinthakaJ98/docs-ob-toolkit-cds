#Upgrading WSO2 Open Banking from 2.0 to 3.0

This section guides on how to upgrade your WSO2 Open Banking 2.0 setup to WSO2 Open Banking 3.0 (Accelerator Model). 

!!! note
    WSO2 Open Banking 2.0 is based on the WSO2 API Manager 3.1.0 and WSO2 Identity Server 5.10.0 products.

!!! tip
    - The DCR applications created in Open Banking 2.0.0 should not contain a SoftwareId/IssuerName that includes an
      underscore **"_"**.
         - If you have such DCR applications, before the migration process, rename the **Service Provider Name**
           of each DCR application's Service Provider application by logging into `https://<IS_HOST>:9446/carbon`.
    - The Migration Client **ONLY** supports Open Banking 2.0.0 environments where the **CDS - Secondary User** feature
      is **not enabled**.
         - If you have already enabled data sharing for Secondary Users, you must await a future
           release of the Migration Client.
